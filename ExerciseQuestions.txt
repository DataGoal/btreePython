BASIC EXERCISES:

1. Get radius from user & find area of circle.
r=input("Enter the radius of circle: ")
Formula: 3.14*r*r

2. Count the number 4 in a given list
myList=[12,4,23,4,3]
Expected result = 2

3. Parse a string to Float or Integer
Eg. input will be "246.2458" as string
Expected out will be 246.2458 as float & 246 as int


4. Write a Python function to test whether a passed letter is a vowel or not.

5. Write function to sum of three given integers. However, if two values are equal sum will be zero
Eg.
If integer is 3, 4, 1 then expected output will be 8
If integer is 3, 4, 3 then expected output will be 0


6. Write a function to get the smallest number from a passed list.
smallNumList = [1, 2, -8, 0]
Expected outout: -8

7. Write a Python function to count the number of strings where the string length is 2 or more and the first and last character are same from a given list of strings.
Sample List : ['abc', 'xyz', 'aba', '1221']
Expected Result : 2



8. Write a Python program to reverse strings in a given list of string values.
Original lists:
['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'White', 'Black']
Reverse strings of the said given list:
['deR', 'neerG', 'eulB', 'etihW', 'kcalB']



9. Write a Python program to sort a given mixed list of integers and strings. Numbers must be sorted before strings.
Original list:
[19, 'red', 12, 'green', 'blue', 10, 'white', 'green', 1]
Sort the given mixed list of integers and strings:
[1, 10, 12, 19, 'blue', 'green', 'green', 'red', 'white']


10. Write a Python program to clone or copy a list.

11. Write a program to check given number is odd or even number.

12. Loop through the letters in the word "banana"
